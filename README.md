# Existing-I2C-HDL-Code-2
IÂ²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) was developed by Philips Semiconductor (now NXP Semiconductors) in 1982.  It is a synchronous, multi-master, multi-slave serial communication protocol designed for low-speed communication between integrated circuits.  Only 2 wires (SCL and SDA) are required for communication, which makes design simpler.
